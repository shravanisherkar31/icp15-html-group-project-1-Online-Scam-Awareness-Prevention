 <h2 align="center">What is a Job Scam?</h2>
            <h3>Job and internship scams are fraudulent job offers created to cheat job 
                seekers by promising high salaries, guaranteed placement, or easy work-from-
                home opportunities. These scams mainly target students, fresh graduates, and 
                unemployed individuals who are actively searching for jobs.
            </h3>
             <h3>Scammers often pretend to be HR managers or recruiters from well-known 
                companies and contact victims through emails, phone calls, WhatsApp messages, 
                or social media platforms.

            <h2>📌 Real-Life Example</h2>
            <p>
                🎓 A college student received a WhatsApp message offering a paid internship
                from a reputed company. The student was asked to pay a small registration fee.
                After making the payment, the contact number was switched off and the job
                offer turned out to be fake.
